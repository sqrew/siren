That's it. Define an instrument, define a melody, play it. Anywhere.

* What It Is

Siren is a chiptune audio engine written in [[https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp][Carp]]. It compiles to C and
depends only on SDL2 — the same library that powers Carp's game ecosystem.
No runtime. No garbage collector. No proprietary dependencies. No license fees.

SDL2 runs on everything worth running on: desktop, Raspberry Pi, embedded ARM,
handheld hardware, art installations, homebrew game consoles. If someone cared
enough to hook up a speaker, SDL2 probably already runs there. So does Siren.

This is the point. Not a feature list — just this: *if there's a speaker, Siren
will play sound.* Minimal code, any hardware, real music.

* Why It Exists

Most audio engines are either:
- *Massive frameworks* (FMOD, Wwise) — proprietary, expensive, overkill
- *Runtime-dependent* (Python, JS) — not truly embeddable
- *Engine-locked* (Unity, Godot audio) — useless outside their host

Siren is none of those. It's a library. You own it completely.

It was built as part of an effort to prove that [[https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp][Carp]] — a compiled Lisp with
no GC and a borrow checker — is a serious general purpose systems language.
Siren is the proof of concept. It works.

It was built as part of an ongoing effort to make Carp viable as a general
purpose systems language — proving that a compiled Lisp with no GC can power
real audio DSP cleanly and ergonomically.

* The Pipeline

#+BEGIN_SRC
Sequencer → Oscillator → Envelope → [Filters] → [Effects] → Mixer → SDL2 → PCM out
#+END_SRC

Every stage is a pure transform on f32 arrays. Data flows one direction.
Ownership is linear. Nothing is shared between stages.

* What You Get

- *5 oscillators* — sine, square, saw, triangle, noise
- *ADSR envelopes* — full state machine, retrigger-safe
- *Step sequencer* — note arrays with rests, loops continuously
- *Preset instruments* — ~(pluck-square 0.4f)~, ~(pad-sine 0.3f)~, ~(bass-saw 0.5f)~
- *88 named notes* — ~note-c4~ through ~note-b7~, all piano keys
- *One-line startup* — ~Siren.run~ owns the engine loop

Coming: filters (biquad LP/HP/BP), effects (delay, reverb, chorus),
LFO, multi-channel mixer.

* Dependencies

- [[https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp][Carp]] — the compiler
- [[https://www.libsdl.org/][SDL2]] — audio output (already required by Carp game projects)

SDL2 is the right choice here — it's already the foundation of Carp's game
ecosystem, so Siren costs nothing extra to include in a Carp game. If Siren
ever needs to run somewhere truly headless (no display, no input, bare metal
audio only), the backend can be swapped to [[https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio][miniaudio]] — a single-header C
library — without touching anything else. The abstraction is already there.

* Status

Early but functional. Real music plays. The architecture is proven.
Not production-hardened — this is a research project and a love letter
to a language that deserves more users.

* Built With

sqrew + Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6) — southern Maine, 2026.
