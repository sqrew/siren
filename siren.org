#+TITLE: Siren — Embedded Audio Engine in Carp
#+DATE: <2026-02-24 Mon>
#+DESCRIPTION: Dense, no-fluff DSP engine. Complete 2D game audio toolkit.

* Vision

Complete 2D game audio toolkit in Carp. No codecs. No presets. No boilerplate.
Signal generation → modulation → processing → mixing → PCM output.
Single-threaded. Chiptune-capable. Dense, fuck-you Carp.

Not tunes. Not 50 algorithms, 150 instruments, 100 drums. Siren is complete
when you can make a full 2D game's soundkit with it and nothing feels missing.
Know when to stop building the engine and start using it.

Every pain point becomes a gotcha, a stdlib PR, or a design discussion with Erik.

All stages: pure transforms on float arrays. Linear ownership. Data flows one direction.

* Modules

** DONE Output (src/SDLAudio.carp + src/siren_audio.h)
- [x] SDL2 raw PCM queue bindings
- [x] C wrapper header (siren_audio.h) flattens SDL_AudioSpec
- [x] open, play, stop, queue, queued-bytes, close
- [ ] SDL_INIT_AUDIO not bound in SDL.carp — using INIT_EVERYTHING for now

** DONE Constants (src/constants.carp)
- [x] sample-rate (44100), channels (2), buf-frames (512)
- [x] buf-size, buf-bytes, queue-target, two-pi

** DONE Signal Generation (src/oscillators.carp)
- [x] sine, square, saw, triangle, noise
- [x] all produce MONO f32 buffers
- [x] uniform API: (Osc.fill-X buf freq phase) → next-phase

** DONE Envelopes (src/envelope.carp)
- [x] ADSR deftype with full state machine (attack→decay→sustain→release→done)
- [x] tick: per-sample amplitude, handles stage transitions mid-buffer
- [x] fill: applies envelope in-place to mono buffer
- [x] note-on! / note-off! — release-from tracks level at note-off
- [x] zero-length segment guards

** DONE Sequencer (src/sequencer.carp)
- [x] Note deftype (freq, dur-ms), Note.rest for rests
- [x] Seq walks note array, fires note-on!/note-off! at correct times
- [x] loops continuously, monophonic

** DONE Core / Pipeline (src/main.carp)
- [x] mono-to-stereo interleave with gain
- [x] full pipeline wired: Seq → Osc → Env → mono-to-stereo → SDL queue
- [x] CONFIRMED WORKING — melody plays

** Filters (src/filters.carp)
- [ ] biquad filter — one implementation, three modes
- [ ] low-pass (warm/dark)
- [ ] high-pass (thin/bright)
- [ ] band-pass (nasal/resonant)
- [ ] cutoff + resonance (Q) parameters

** Effects (src/effects.carp)
- [ ] delay/echo — feedback delay line, delay-ms + feedback parameters
- [ ] simple reverb — Schroeder comb+allpass network
- [ ] chorus/flanger — modulated delay line, subtle width/movement

** LFO (src/lfo.carp)
- [ ] oscillator at control rate (not audio rate)
- [ ] routable to: pitch, filter cutoff, volume
- [ ] rate (hz) + depth parameters
- [ ] waveform: sine or triangle (slow oscillation, no aliasing concern)

** Mixer (src/mixer.carp)
- [ ] N mono channels (target: 8)
- [ ] per-channel gain + pan
- [ ] stereo sum to output buffer
- [ ] enables polyphony and layering (melody + bass + drums)

** Quality of Life (src/main.carp or src/util.carp)
- [ ] BPM-synced sequencer (tempo in BPM, note lengths as fractions)
- [ ] chord/arpeggio helpers
- [ ] named note frequencies (note-c4, note-g4, etc. — avoid magic numbers)

* Ceiling

This is done when you can build a full 2D game's audio with it:
- Melody line
- Bass line
- Percussion (noise + short envelope)
- Ambient pad (long attack/release, maybe with chorus)
- Sound effects (one-shot envelopes on various waveforms)

Positional audio (pan by X, attenuate by distance) deferred — no 3D in Carp yet.
Revisit when WGPU render pipeline lands and 3D becomes possible.

* Pain Points Log
/Each entry is a potential stdlib PR or gotcha./

- SDL.init returns () not Int — can't check return value, SDL_INIT_AUDIO not bound
- Float.pi is a def not defn — no parens, easy to confuse
- Float.from-int not Int.to-float — naming not obvious
- All arithmetic strictly binary — (+ a b c) fails, must nest
- Array.unsafe-raw needed to get Ptr without taking ownership
- Array.fill! doesn't exist — zero a buffer with a for loop

* Constants
- Sample rate: 44100
- Buffer size: 512 frames (chiptune-appropriate, low latency)
- Channels: 2 (stereo output, mono internally until mixer)
- Format: f32 throughout, interleaved stereo at output boundary
